# Contributing to Minecraftly

Howdy! We're really excited that you are interested in contributing to Minecraftly. Before submitting your contribution, please take a moment and read through the following guidelines.

## Reporting Bugs

- Before opening an issue, debug your problem by following [these instructions](https://github.com/minecraftly/minecraftly/wiki). Only open an issue if you are confident it is a bug with Minecraftly, not with your own setup.

- All issues should be reported on the [minecraftly/minecraftly/issues](https://github.com/minecraftly/minecraftly/issues) repository. Issues pertaining to a specific extension should include the extension name in their title, e.g. `[Tags] Issue title`.

- Try to search for your issue â€“ it may have already been answered or even fixed in the development branch.

- Check if the issue is reproducible with the latest version of Minecraftly. If you are using a pre-release or development version, please indicate the specific version you are using.

- It is **required** that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Issues with no clear repro steps will not be triaged. If an issue labeled "needs verification" receives no further input from the issue author for more than 5 days, it will be closed.
